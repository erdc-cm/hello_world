# hello_world
A very simple software package example that includes a Makefile

# Things you can do
Call make with no arguments to see what the default `all` target builds
```bash
make 
```

Get rid  of all intermediate objects and targets `distclean`
```bash
make distclean
```

Make a particular target: `hello`

```bash
make hello
```

Clean the directory of intermediate objects but leave the software executable

```bash
make clean
```
